   <p>According to universal law of gravitation the force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p>
<p>This means that : <b>F ∝ m<sub>1</sub>* m<sub>2</sub> .......equation first <br>

        <li><b>Altitude:</b>On increasing the distance from the centre of earth the value of g decreases.</li>

<div class="question">
    4.Why does an object release from the poles reaches faster that the other ball released from the equator ?
    <p> ANS:- This happens because the value of g is more in poles that equator so, when  an object release <br> from the poles reaches faster that the other ball released from the equator </p>
 <p>5.What will effect of g when we go up on the hill ?</p>
 <p>ANS:- When we go up on the hill the distance from the centre of earth increases and the value of g decreases.</p>

    <p>According to Archimede's principle the when an object is partially immersed or wholly immersed <br> is experinces to exert a buoyant force which is equal to the weight of the water displaced.</p>

<div class="question">
    <p> 20.Why it is easy to float on salt water than fresh water ?</p>
    <p><b>Ans:</b>The density of salt water is more than fresh water due to which is easy to float on salt water than fresh water</p>
    <p>21.Why ship floats ?</p>
    <P><b>Ans:</b> A ship made up of hollow steel and iron which container a lot of air due to which its average density become less than density of water.And is diplaces a lot of water due to which more buoynat force exerts and ship can float.
